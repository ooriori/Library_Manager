ðŸ¦€ Project: Library Manager in Rust 

This repository proposes a small project but with enough context to address key concepts of ownership, borrowing and lifetimes in Rust. 

ðŸ’¡ Project idea A simple library manager that:

Allows you to create books with title and author. Save the books to a list. It allows you to "lend" books without transferring ownership (borrowing). Shows available and borrowed books. Allows books to be returned to inventory.

ðŸŽ¯ Why this idea? This project allows you to practice and understand: 
Using struct with String â†’ ownership management. References (&) â†’ temporary loans. Mutability and mutable references (&mut). Transfer of ownership (move values). Life cycles (lifetimes) and how Rust handles them. All code is developed step by step, with detailed feedback, ideal for learning and sharing knowledge.
